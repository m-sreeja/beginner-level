				There are many programming languages like c,c++,Java,etc... which are used to code and obtain the desired output.
				We also have Scripting languages like HTML,CSS,XHTML,etc... which are scripted to obtain dynamic output.
				The information collected from client is stored to database by means of Query languages.

			   A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
               Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.

				A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted, rather than compiled.
                The term "scripting language" is also used loosely to refer to dynamic high-level general-purpose languages.sThese languages were originally developed for use within a particular environment, and later developed into portable domain-specific or general-purpose languages.
