			<h2>Blog by Kavya</h2>
			<small>Posted on 29/May/2020</small>
			<p>The most beautiful and intelligent girl in the world. Sometimes insecure and shy, but really social and talkative when you get to know her. She cares a lot for her friends and her family, and is really passionate about life. She cares about you, even when you don't care about yourself, and in a relationship, will love you unconditionally. She is funny and has a great sense of humor. She'll laugh at all your bad puns and memes (even the mixtape jokes), and is absolutely brilliant for knowing that pineapple DOES belong on pizza. She knows when you're upset, sad, or feeling depressed, and will do everything she can to cheer you up. She has amazing eyes, a spectacular smile, and a beautiful laugh. She is the best girl a guy could ever ask for!</p>
